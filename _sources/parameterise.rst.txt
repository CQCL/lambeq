Step 3: Parameterisation
========================

Up to this point of the pipeline, a sentence is still represented as a string diagram, independent of any low-level decisions such as tensor dimensions or specific quantum gate choices. This abstract form can be turned into a concrete quantum circuit or tensor network by applying ans채tze. An *ansatz* can be seen as a map that determines choices such as the number of qubits that every wire of the string diagram is associated with and the concrete parameterised quantum states that correspond to each word. In ``lambeq``, ans채tze can be added by extending one of the classes :py:class:`.TensorAnsatz` or :py:class:`.CircuitAnsatz`, depending on the type of the experiment.

Quantum case
------------

For the quantum case, the library comes equipped with the class :py:class:`.IQPAnsatz`, which turns the string diagram into a standard IQP circuit [#f1]_.

.. code-block:: python

  from lambeq.ccg2discocat import DepCCGParser

  sentence = 'John walks in the park'

  # Get a string diagram
  depccg_parser = DepCCGParser()
  diagram = depccg_parser.sentence2diagram(sentence)

In order to create an :py:class:`.IQPAnsatz` instance, we need to define the number of qubits for all atomic types that occur in the diagram -- in this case, for the noun type and the sentence type. The following code produces a circuit by assigning 1 qubit to the noun type and 1 qubit to the sentence type. Further, the number of IQP layers (``n_layers``) is set to 1.

.. code-block:: python

  from lambeq.circuit import IQPAnsatz
  from lambeq.core.types import AtomicType

  # Define atomic types
  N = AtomicType.NOUN
  S = AtomicType.SENTENCE

  # Convert string diagram to quantum circuit
  ansatz = IQPAnsatz({N: 1, S: 1}, n_layers=1)
  discopy_circuit = ansatz(diagram)
  discopy_circuit.draw()

This produces a quantum circuit in ``discopy`` form:

.. image:: ./_static/images/circuit.png

Conversion to ``pytket`` format is very simple:

.. code-block:: python

   # Convert to pytket form
   tket_circuit = discopy_circuit.to_tk()

Exporting to ``pytket`` format provides additional functionality and allows interoperability. For example, obtaining a ``qiskit`` circuit is trivial:

.. code-block:: python

  from pytket.extensions.qiskit import tk_to_qiskit

  qiskit_circuit = tk_to_qiskit(tket_circuit)
  qiskit_circuit.draw(output='mpl')

.. image:: ./_static/images/qiskit-circuit.png

Classical case
--------------
In the case of a classical experiment, instantiating one of the tensor ans채tze requires the user to assign dimensions to each one of the atomic types occurring in the diagram. In the following code, we parameterise a :py:class:`.TensorAnsatz` instance with :math:`d_n=4` for the base dimension of the noun space, and :math:`d_s=2` as the dimension of the sentence space:

.. code-block:: python

   from lambeq.tensor import TensorAnsatz
   from discopy import Dim

   tensor_ansatz = TensorAnsatz({N: Dim(4), S: Dim(2)})
   diagram = tensor_ansatz(diagram)

This produces the following string diagram/tensor network:

.. image:: ./_static/images/tensor_ansatz.png

Note that the wires of the diagram are now annotated with the dimensions corresponding to each type, indicating that the result is a concrete tensor network.

Matrix product states
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In classical experiments of this kind, the tensors associated with certain words, such as conjunctions, can become extremely large. In some cases, the order of these tensors can be 12 or even higher (:math:`d^{12}` elements, where :math:`d` is the base dimension), which makes efficient execution of the experiment impossible. In order to address this problem, ``lambeq`` includes ans채tze for converting tensors into various forms of *matrix product states* (MPSs).

The following code applies the :py:class:`.SpiderAnsatz` class, which splits tensors with order greater than 2 to sequences of order-2 tensors (i.e. matrices), connected with spiders.

.. code-block:: python

   from lambeq.tensor import SpiderAnsatz

   spider_ansatz = SpiderAnsatz({N: Dim(4), S: Dim(2)})
   spider_diagram = spider_ansatz(diagram)
   spider_diagram.draw(figsize=(13,6), fontsize=13)

The result is the following:

.. image:: ./_static/images/spider_ansatz.png

Note that the preposition "in" is now represented by a matrix product state of 4 linked matrices, which is a very substantial reduction in the space required to store the tensors.

Another option is the :py:class:`.MPSAnsatz` class, which converts large tensors to sequences of order-3 tensors connected with cups. In this setting, the user needs to also define the *bond dimension*, that is, the dimensionality of the wire that connects the tensors together.

.. code-block:: python

   from lambeq.tensor import MPSAnsatz

   mps_ansatz = MPSAnsatz({N: Dim(4), S: Dim(2)}, bond_dim=3)
   mps_diagram = mps_ansatz(diagram)
   mps_diagram.draw(figsize=(13,7), fontsize=13)
