``lambeq`` is an open-source, modular, extensible high-level Python library for experimental Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP), created by `CQC <https://cambridgequantum.com>`_'s QNLP team. At a high level, the library allows the conversion of any sentence to a quantum circuit, based on a given compositional model and certain parameterisation and choices of ans√§tze.

``lambeq`` is available for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9, on Linux, MacOS and Windows. To install, see :ref:`sec-installation`. To start the tutorial, go to :ref:`sec-sentence-input`. To see the example notebooks, go to :ref:`sec-examples`.
