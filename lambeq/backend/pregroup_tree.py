class PregroupTreeNode:
    """
    A node in a pregroup tree.

    A pregroup tree is a compact tree-like representation of a pregroup
    diagram. Each node in the tree represents a token in the sentence,
    annotated with the pregroup type of the outcome wire(s) expected
    from this word, e.g. `s` for a verb, `n` for an adjective, `n.r@s`
    for an adverb and so on. The root of the tree is the head word in
    the sentence (i.e a word with free wires, usually an `s`,
    that deliver the state of the sentence after the composition),
    and the branches of the tree represent cups identifying
    input wires (cups) to the parent node.

    Example
    -------
    Consider the sentence "John gave Mary a flower", with the
    following pregroup diagram:

    ```
    John       gave      Mary    a    flower
    ────  ─────────────  ────  ─────  ──────
     n    n.r·s·n.l·n.l   n    n·n.l    n
     ╰────╯   │  │   ╰────╯    │  ╰─────╯
              │  ╰─────────────╯
    ```

    The tree for this diagram becomes:

    ```
    gave_1 (s)
      ├ John_0 (n)
      ├ Mary_2 (n)
      └ a_3 (n)
        └ flower_4 (n)
    ```

    where the numbers after the underscore indicate the order of each
    word in the sentence. This representation is sufficient for
    reconstructing the original pregroup diagram, since the original
    types of the nodes can be recovered by following the parent-child
    relationships in the tree and adding the necessary type adjoints
    to accomodate the arguments in the type of the parent.

    Notes
    -----
    Since the original pregroup diagram can contain cycles, any nodes
    with more than one parents will be duplicated to allow a tree-like
    representation.
