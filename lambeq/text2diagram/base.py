Reader
======
A :py:class:`Reader` is a parser that turns sentences into DisCoPy
diagrams, but not according to the DisCoCat model.

For example, the :py:class:`LinearReader` combines linearly from
left-to-right.

Subclass :py:class:`Reader` to define a custom reader.

Some simple example readers are included for use:
    :py:data:`cups_reader` : :py:class:`LinearReader`
        This combines each pair of adjacent word boxes with a cup. This
        requires each word box to have the output :py:obj:`S >> S` to
        expose two output wires, and a sentinel start box is used to
        connect to the first word box. Also available under the name
        :py:data:`word_sequence_reader`.
    :py:data:`spiders_reader` : :py:class:`LinearReader`
        This compines the word boxes using a spider with one output of
        type :py:obj:`S`. Also available under the name
        :py:data:`bag_of_words_reader`.
    :py:data:`stairs_reader` : :py:class:`LinearReader`
        This combines the first two word boxes with a combining box that
        has a single output. Then, each word box is combined with the
        output from the previous combining box to produce a stair-like
        pattern.

See `examples/readers.ipynb` for illustrative usage.
